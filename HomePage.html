	This is my personal website to practice web development skills and tools.

	<img src=" Mickey.jpg" alt="Mickey" width="104" height="142"> 

	<p>
	It also serves as a place to host my currently active projects.<br> 
	The goal is to improve the website alongside my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS <br> 
	and to highlight my projects better than linkedin or my resume can. <br>
	<br>
	My goal with this website side project was to start with no previous knowledge of webdesign<br>
	and from scratch without any website builder go through the stages of raw html, html with css <br>
	(looking like a 90s webpage) to transition to the final stage of having a professional webpage.
