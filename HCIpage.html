                        Welcome! This is our remote HCI Experiment for SEng 411 at the University of Victoria.
                        <br> In this experiment, several numbers will be randomly generated by text or bar chart from 0 to 99 on the 400x400 screen (currently outlined with the black X below). 
                        <br> Please select the <b>largest number/the longest bar</b> as quickly as possible after you see it displayed. After each selection, the experiment will automatically generate a new group of numbers/bars. There is a total of 80 trials in our experiment（text:40 & bar:40）and should take 10-15 minutes. When you see "Here is the end of the experiment" that means this experiment is done.
                        <br><br><b>Note:</b> Your responses are automatically sent to a Google Sheet after each selection.  All responses are annomyous and tracked only with a random UUID generated for each run of the experiment. The use of browser extensions such as Privacy Badger may stop your data from being sent correctly. This experiment has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge and was designed to be done with a mouse. 
                        <br><br> Before starting the experiment, please read the "Process" carefully below.
                        <br> <b>Process:</b>
                        <br> 1. Press the "Start Experiment!" button.
                        <br> 2. A series of values will be displayed below. 
                        <br> 3. Select the largest value displayed. (incorrect selections will be recorded with their error and that trial will end)
                        <br> 4. Continue selecting the largest value until the experiment is finished.
                        <br> 5. Complete the exit survey.
