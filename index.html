      <p> Welcome to my website. I have a huge drive for improving usability and accessibility and advocating 
          for proper usability testing and design in products from the ground up. In my experience there have 
          been products that have little to no consideration for usability in their design. It should be obvious 
          and well known that retroactively dealing with any issues from mismatched requirements, bugs, or redesigns
           places a cost multiplier on the work done. It is far cheaper and creates a far better product to put the 
           systems and tools to deal with these issues in place from the beginning. I am passionate about this message
            and intend to be a strong advocate for it.

            <p> Python</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> Being the first language I learned back in highschool, I have used Python for many projects.
                Most notably of late I used it in a software security class to script some encyrption/decryption exercises.
                The largest project to use Python is probably Chatcity 1.0 with the use of 
                Python sockets and the attempted use of multithreading in Python. </p>

            <p> C</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> The first language taught at the University level and a staple of many of the more
                computer engineering focused classes. I have used C to program on microcontrollers,
                to investigate u-threads and p-threads, and used a variant of the language (Robot C) to
                program a autonomus robot to navigate it's environment and locate an IR beacon. </p>

            <p> C++</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> Introduced to C++ at a Coop software developer position I was immediately intrigued by it.
                To further my further my understanding of the language to ensure I wasn't just blundering through the language with future
                projects I enrolled in an advanced programming techniques for C++ class at the University of Victoria. While it was probably
                one of the hardest classes I have taken it was also a constant string of learning moments. </p>

            <p> SonarQube</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> As part of a Software Quality Engineering project I was introduced to the code quality and security testing tool SonarQube.
                Requiring only a small amount of time to eliminate false negatives the number of valuable catches that lead to code quality improvements was insipring. 
                Easily included into continous integration pipelines and supporiting 27 languages it is a tool I plan on becoming more familiar with. </p>

                some would argue that that is a good thing, my experience with Bash has been more about

                competition was my way of diving into the language and being forced to just figure it out. After

        My partner Marcin Leciej and I were tasked with writting a program for an embedded system that used the sum of absolute differences algorithm for calculating the vectors when attempting motion estimation between two images.
        The goal of the project was to write the most efficient implementation that would then be run on a 32 bit ARM processor.
        The project was done in three stages. An initial naive implementation was written in pure C where the only optimization was using cache efficient array traversal.
        The second iteration of the program used Neon Intrinsics and software pipelining to reduce the number of cycles required to compute the SAD values. The final iteration 
        invovled assembly inlining that would be used if the a new hardware supported instruction could be implemented. Alongside this code 
        was the design of the theoretical hardware instruction.</p>

        Neptune Banking was a mock legacy banking application that used a Spring Boot (Java) back-end and Node Js front-end. It suffered from a series of bugs, code quality and security issues, and missing features. 
        Working in a team of 6 a requirements specification document was written to match provided version of the application along with a list of desired features.
        A continous integration pipleine was implemented using Jenkins that, following a peer code review of merge requests, performed unit tests, front-end tests with Selenium, and scanned the application for 
        code quality and security issues using SonarQube. Over the course of 4 months bugs were fixed, features were implemented, and unit tests and front-end tests were written.

        SimpleStockShare is a mock stock trading application that is designed with software scalability in mind. Originally started in a team of three but maintained after one of the developers 
        stopped contributing and then dropped out of the class. The application was broken into a series of dockerized components to allow for distribution across resources. The application had strict requirements
        including the use of a preexisting server that supplied the quoted values of stocks. The main transaction server componenet used Spring Boot. Quotes from the legacy quote server were stored, where applicable, 
        in a cache implemented using Redis. The application used Glowroot for performance analysis and a workload generator written in Python designed to simulate n users simultaneously making transacion requests. 
        The final implementation of the application easily supported 1200 concurrent users with an average transaciton speed of ~25,000 transactions per minute.</p>

        <p> 
            In my first semester of the Software Engineering program at UVic the entire year was
            tasked with desinging a solution for the lack of efficient accesibility options with 
            the boarding process for BC Ferries. As a member of a four person team, following the Tuckman team design cycle, we developed a solution to BC Ferries’ terminal 
            accessibility problem named A.D.E.P.T (Alternative Disabled Electric Personal Transport). Judged by members BC Ferries Executives 
            and Members of the Engineering Faculties the project won first place.

      <p> Early in my second year of the Software Engineering program at UVic as a part of my Software Architecture and Design class
          2 other students and I were tasked with documenting, desinging, and programing a chat communication system
          that used python sockets. Without any prior knowledge of network programming or the writing of web applications
          we developed Chatcity. Using Python sockets, multithreading, and PyGui implemented the system on schedule and 
          meeting all requirements.<br><br>
