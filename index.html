      <p> Welcome to my website. I have a huge drive for improving usability and accessibility and advocating 
          for proper usability testing and design in products from the ground up. In my experience there have 
          been products that have little to no consideration for usability in their design. It should be obvious 
          and well known that retroactively dealing with any issues from mismatched requirements, bugs, or redesigns
           places a cost multiplier on the work done. It is far cheaper and creates a far better product to put the 
           systems and tools to deal with these issues in place from the beginning. I am passionate about this message
            and intend to be a strong advocate for it.

            <p> Python</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> Being the first language I learned back in highschool, I have used Python for many projects.
                Most notably of late I used it in a software security class to script some encyrption/decryption exercises.
                The largest project to use Python is probably Chatcity 1.0 with the use of 
                Python sockets and the attempted use of multithreading in Python. </p>

            <p> C</p>
            <p class = "w3-hide-small"> The first language taught at the University level and a staple of many of the more
                computer engineering focused classes. I have used C to program on microcontrollers,
                to investigate u-threads and p-threads, and used a variant of the language (Robot C) to
                program a autonomus robot to navigate it's environment and locate an IR beacon. </p>

                To further my further my understanding of the language to ensure I wasn't just blundering through the language with future
                projects I enrolled in an advanced programming techniques for C++ class at the University of Victoria. While it was probably
                one of the hardest classes I have taken it was also a constant string of learning moments. </p>

	  <p> 
        In my first semester of the Software Engineering program at UVic the entire year was
        tasked with desinging a solution for the lack of efficient accesibility options with 
        the boarding process for BC Ferries. As a member of a four person team, following the Tuckman team design cycle, we developed a solution to BC Ferries’ terminal 
        accessibility problem named A.D.E.P.T (Alternative Disabled Electric Personal Transport). Judged by members BC Ferries Executives 
        and Members of the Engineering Faculties the project won first place.

      <p> Early in my second year of the Software Engineering program at UVic as a part of my Software Architecture and Design class
          2 other students and I were tasked with documenting, desinging, and programing a chat communication system
          that used python sockets. Without any prior knowledge of network programming or the writing of web applications
          we developed Chatcity. Using Python sockets, multithreading, and PyGui implemented the system on schedule and 
          meeting all requirements.<br><br>
