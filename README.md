# My personal website hosted on Github Pages
Finally got around to making my own personal website. To avoid spending money on hosting before I've finished making my polished webpage I've decided to host it on Github pages.

## Getting Started
Just go to jjcomish.github.io for the latest version of my website.

## Authors
Juan James Comish - it's my website

## Acknowledgements
Thanks be to w3 templates for allowing version 1.0 of the website to look so polished without requiring me to make an entire stylesheet.
